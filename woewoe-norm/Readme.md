# WöWö Normalization

A set of transducers that 
- normalize WöWö orthography against North Markian
- and annotate WöWö (candidate) lemmas with WöWö links
- we only link single-word expressions, and only the last only the longest, non-|-separated alternative (this is because this is not fully systematicized)
