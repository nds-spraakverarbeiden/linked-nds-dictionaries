At the moment, we do not provide hosting for Plautdietsch data, so we point to the (HTML) website, instead. However, these links do not resolve, but point to (unspecified) HTML anchors, because they were not differentiated by different URLs at the original site.

In fact, there are some more PDT dictionaries online, and also some literature, but these should be subject to a coordinated effort on Plautdietsch rather than Low German, because the speaker communities have been divided for almost 300 years, and the Plautdietsch lexicon incorporated a lot of loan vocabulary not representative for Low German. Inherited words are well comprehensible, but have quite distinctive phonetics.
